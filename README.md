## Data Mining Project (2019)

This is a learning exercise and presentation I've put togethor in order to better understand Text Analytics. This exercise utilizes *Text Mining with R* by Julia Silge and David Robinson. Follow this [link](https://www.tidytextmining.com) to the online resource.

The presentation was given to the Monitoring and Evaluation Capacity-building team, and is a use-case example intended to illustrate how text analystics can be applied to qualitative analyses. The presentation inludes basic structuring of text into a tidy format, basic analysis using counts and filters, and an in-depth look at sentiment analysis.

Language: R

Packages: tidyverse, tidytext, ggplot2, guntenbergr
